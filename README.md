This project involves using KMeans clustering to segment mall customers based on their demographic and spending behavior. 
The dataset includes features like CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
By focusing on Annual Income and Spending Score, the analysis uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters,
helping to group customers into categories such as Low Income, Low Spending and High Income, High Spending. 
This segmentation aids in targeted marketing and customer service strategies, enabling businesses to tailor their efforts based on distinct customer groups.
